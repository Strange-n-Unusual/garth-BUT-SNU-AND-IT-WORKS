Hey guys (as in, anyone who managed to find this site), I mostly go by Feli on-line and I welcome you to my little database of strange-and-usual stories! 

<!-- more -->

I’ve only really gathered a few, and still need to get them cleaned up before I post them all here. They’re mostly accounts of various folks I know, although I’ve got a set of letters or two!(actually, only one. it just sounds better to say it like that) I’m hosting it on GitHub for now, it’s easier that way. I don’t exactly feel like writing it all down by hand, and I’d loathe to use my phone, so the internet shall take its place as my personal archive! I don’t think it’s going to be too ad-riddled on here either. Don’t expect anything fancy either, this is for my own purposes first and foremost, though I don’t mind someone reading. See you once I get the first one formatted!
